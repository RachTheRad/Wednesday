Long ago in a land far away (Royal Oak, MI in the late '80s) a girl was born. She was destined to live a fairly normal life while traversing the great states of the Americas. Eventually she settled in the land of Kentucky and found herself a husband who was a better cook than her (thus ensuring every night she would be well fed). They were joined on their adventures by the faithful, silent Teddy (aka the Dog Who Thought He Was A Cat). Not long after Lillian, Great Empress of the World, was born to the delight and fear of all who met her. 

Currently Rachel hopes to learn coding so she might expand her skills and find more fulfilling employment.
